# Multi Vehicle Route Planning
A simple python library for playing around with multi vehcile
route optimisation. Inspired by 2009 paper [Optimization of Multiple
Vehicle Routing Problems Using Approximation Algorithms](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/45897065_Optimization_of_Multiple_Vehicle_Routing_Problems_Using_Approximation_Algorithms).
